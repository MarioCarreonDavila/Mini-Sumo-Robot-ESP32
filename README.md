# Mini-Sumo-Robot-ESP32
Mini sumo robot using ESP32 for competition in 2024

This project consists of a mini sumo robot that is capable of searching for and detecting the enemy 
robot, so I can get him out of the arena. The arena is the circular area where robots "fight" trying
to get the other one out.

## Features 
- 2 DC Pololu motors.
- Connection diagram designed in EasyEDA.
- Carcass desgned in SolidWorks.
- Simple program for movement.
- Automated movement to find the oponent and take it out of the arena.
- Programmed using ESP32 and Platformio in Visual Studio Code framework.

## Technologies
- ESP32
- C / C++
- EasyEDA
- PWM control
- 2 Sharp distance sensors
- 2 Infrared sensors

## What I learned
- Sometimes, the simpler the program, the better.
- Circuit design and accommodation.
- Sensor feedback.

This project was developed as part of my Robotics Engineering degree.
